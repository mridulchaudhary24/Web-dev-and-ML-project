# Web-dev-and-ML-project
Hello guys,
In this project I have made a website which takes certain number of inputs from user and predicts the chances in percentage whether a person is having any heart disease or not and also advices the person whether he/she should book an appointment with doctor or not.

For ML model I used python
For frontend I used HTML and CSS
For backend I used flask
